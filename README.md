# Touche-COBOL
Simple 2v2 battleship COBOL game.

## How to play
First things first, compile it using any compiler or transpiler, I use GNUCOBOL `cobc -free -x -o touche-cobol touche-cobol.cob`

Then execute using `./touche-cobol`

The program use fullscreen display, so inputs showed by the trailing underscores. You will first have to input the first player's name and his fleet, same for second player.

Have fun.

## Requirements
cobc 3.1.2.0
